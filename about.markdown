I'm William da Silva, Android developer and owner of amazing ideas inside my head where "tomorrow I start" is constantly shifting to... well... tomorrow...

Many initial chapters of my life happened in Brazil where I was born, and since 2017 it has moved to UK, where I curently live, work, play games and read some books.

As said in the first paragraph (have you read it?), I have quite some ideas as side-projects/hobbies, but isn't often when I do some of these. But hey! I've started and published this About section at least!
Will keep posting here some snippets of new tech and libraries I play around, and share some ideas and contents not always related to thecnology/food (yeah I cook and bake and try to create some recipes of my own...)

I hope you enjoy my content and if you didn't like some post, don't worry, maybe it was for me, not for you, or maybe it was for someone else...
